You have four friends: Peter, Juan, Alice, and Mary. They are 24, 22, 23 and 24 years-old, respectively. You know that they all have pets, respectively: a dog, a cat, a goldfish, and a turtle. You want to use your new R skills to create a easy look-up of your friends, their age and their pets. 

1) First, create two named vectors "pets" and "ages". Follow the name order given above.

2) Now, make sure your two vectors are represented as factors. 

3) Use the structure function to check what type of variable each vector is.

4) Now, using index selection, check the pets in the elements with indexes 2 and 4.

5) Using your friend's name, check which pet Alice has.

6) You decided to add 3 more friends to the look-up: Aubrey, Sammy and Ali. You know Aubrey and Ali both have cats, but you don't know if Sammy has a pet. They are 25, 21 and 26, respectively. Add them to the respective vectors.

7) Using operators, filter the friends that are 24 or older and create a new vector called "older".

8) Now, using our 3 variables (friends names, pets and ages), create a data frame called "friends". Name the columns "names", "pets", and "ages".

9) Using the subset function, select the friends that are older than 23 and that have a cat.

10) You find out that Sammy has a dog. Using the function "replace", add the information to the right column. We did not see exactly how to perform this operation in the lab, so this will require some research.
